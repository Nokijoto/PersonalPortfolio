      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I have been passionate about technology since a young age, and I am particularly interested in creating backend solutions. My interests have focused on various technologies and frameworks that enable the creation of efficient and scalable applications. I am currently studying at the <b>UITM in Rzeszow</b>, where I am developing my programming skills and expanding my knowledge of software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of my internship at <b>CogniForge AI</b>, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, which allowed me to gain valuable experience in developing backend solutions. I learned to use various technologies such as PHP, Laravel, as well as Agile methodologies, which enabled me to better understand the software development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this internship, I had the opportunity to work with a team of developers, which taught me teamwork and team communication. The completed projects helped me develop my analytical and problem-solving skills, which is essential in the work of a programmer. My goal is to further develop my skills in the backend area and strive to create innovative solutions that can bring real benefits to users.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I like to read books that expand my knowledge in various technology fields. I am particularly interested in the areas of DevOps and cyber security. I try to keep up to date with news in these areas, which helps me better understand how to effectively manage infrastructure and secure applications from threats.
